# MMSR Writer App

A new MMSR writer app developed with Flutter.

Some of the codes might show error is due to the affect of Flutter version, we are using Flutter 1.10.1 (around this version, cannot remember the exact version) for these codes. Correction: Flutter 1.9.1 + hotfix.4 
1. To downgrade the flutter version, enter this instruction into the TERMINAL:-
   flutter version v1.9.1+hotfix.4

# A Warm Reminder to Person Who Take Over This Project:
1. Due to this project is created without reference, the codes are extremely messy therefore I strongly recommend person who take over to re-build the project instead of modify from our code.
2. The UI can be enhance as we only created the prototype.
3. Function that unable to reproduce may try to refer to our codes.
4. We created this project not fully following OOP method, therefore its actually a "nightmare" when viewving the code.
5. Highly recommend peoples who take over this project apply OOP method.
6. Do note that some dependencies might be the cause where you're having errors.
7. Study the S.O.L.I.D principles: https://medium.com/flutter-community/s-o-l-i-d-the-first-5-principles-of-object-oriented-design-with-dart-f31d62135b7e

# General Rule of Thumb
1. If you see the keyword new or const, it is probably written before they become optional. Omit these keywords to make your code easier to read.
2. Use stateless widgets whenever possible.
3. Split your widget into digestible pieces, into functions in the same class or even different classes.

# Note
1. "FutureBuilder". Mainly used to retrieve data from either local database or server database.
2. "void initstate()". This function will automatically run once when the Stateful widget start to run.
3. "Scaffold". A Scaffold Widget provides a framework which implements the basic material design visual layout structure of the flutter app. It provides APIs for showing appbar, floating action button, body, etc.
4. "?:" operator. Advance if else statement.
5. "Uint8List". Image bytes variable type.
6. "ListView.builder". Build a list of object depend on the length of the array variable.
7. "Navigator.push()". Navigate to target page.
8. "Navigator.pop()". Back to previous page.
9. "MediaQuery.of(context).size.height". Height of the device screen.
10. "MediaQuery.of(context).size.width". Width of the device screen.
